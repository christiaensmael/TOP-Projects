The Odin Project - Project Folder

Fist assignment:
Odin Recipes is a project that I needed to code to
resume on The Odin Project curriculum. Hereby I needed
to code a basic website with some recipes of my choosing.

For this project I needed to know the basics of HTML so I could code a
- Homepage with title and links to the recipes
- Recipe page including a picture, description, ingredients method and a
button with a link to go back to the home page.
