# The Odin Project - Odin Recipes

Odin Recipes is the first assignment of 'The Odin Project" curriculum. For this assignment I needed to learn the basics of HTML, So that I could code a simple recipes website with a homepage and some recipe pages.

On the homepage I needed to code:
- A header for the title 
- Links to the recipes

On the recipe page I needed to code:
- A header for the title
- An image of the dish
- A header for the description
- A paragraph for the description
- A header for the ingredients
- an unordered list for the ingredients
- a header for the steps
- a ordered list for the steps
- a button to the homepage

After I coded the basic html, I also added a CSS stylesheet to design the webpages.
